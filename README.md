<h1> Cheetah Ball Control </h1>

As the electrical lead on the Rice CACTI Engineering Team, I have been responsible for the electrical design and control software for the Rice CACTI "Teaspoon" Cheetah Ball prototype. This has been a mixed-discipline independent student team working to develop a working cheetah enrichment device for the Houston Zoo. 


We recently presented our poster and functional prototype at the 2025 Huff Engineering Showcase and are on track to hand off our prototype in May to the zoo for approval over the summer and in-habitat testing in August.
